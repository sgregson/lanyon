Another night flight, this one was a little more intentional.

I've been getting better at line-of-sight, so I took it through the trees a little. Predictable crashes to be had there. Dust was fun to get the reflectance in the LED panel but not worth the follow-up cleaning (wet wipes and pressurized aircan).

## Crashes:

- 2 trees grazes, causing minor prop chipping and folding one prop arm (1 trunk, 1 branch overhead while FPV)
- 2 inversions, and somehow made a flat spin? that was a bit of a surprise - and again: predictably crashed.

I've since learned that one needs to teach their co-pilots (spectators / spotters) how to indicate directional obstacles. And, while my line-of-sight flying on this copter's improving, I'm still very much a FPV rookie. Three aspects to a good obstacle alert:

1. **Obstacle type**
  - tree / stump / fence / person (person implies critical stop)
2. **Directions**
  - High / Low (up/down)
  - Front / Back (ahead/behind)
  - Left / Right
3. **Criticality**
  - Near
  - Now
4. ***"DROP!"***
  - fall-out-of-the-sky mode, critical problem imminent
  
## Next Purchases:

- replacement d4r-ii antennae (buy a pair, or three)
- 

## Next configuration:

- f/s on d4r-ii
- dominator DVR
- PID tweaks? investigate non-AnthonyRC protune with acceptable angle mode
