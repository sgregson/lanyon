...I guess a lollipop is half of a figure eight? This will probably be the last "Maiden"-theme post. I'm getting half decent at flying this beast line-of-sight, but that doesn't mean you don't hit stuff.

Emphasis of this practice session was yaw control and reversed-frame-of-reference flying. It's pretty uncomfortable flying back at yourself when LOS when the roll direction isn't so predictable, but again - the more horizontal velocity you have, the better.

*skimmed the ground on that one, I didn't think i'd be able to recover from the ground impact. Funny enough, putting it into "config" mode to turn off gave enough yaw that the vortex took off again with some projectile nice arc. oops.*
