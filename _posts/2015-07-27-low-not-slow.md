It was a busy day so I stuck to low and quick, trying to keep very tight control over my elevation. I'm pretty pleased with the line-of-sight cellphone camera, but i'm still struggling with this NTSC/PAL DVR issue. I had originally thought it was an issue with the DVR, but now I'm beginning to think it's a configuration option that I've screwed up on the copter itself!

Also, I'm pleased to report that the 1800mah turnigy a-series battery fits on the frame! It's a close fit, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get the balance correct.
