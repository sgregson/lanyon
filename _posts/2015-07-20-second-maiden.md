Objective this time around was to get better at throttle control and executing yaw/roll moves at the same time (radial motion). Generally happy with how that all worked out.

- Walk-the-dog
- Out-and-back
- Out-and-back with orientation change
- Launch + Descend (avoid [vortex ring state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring_state ""Leaf on the Wind""))

Took one hard landing which made the front-right prop arm collapse, but that's as intended. Awesome.

Also, a little boy came up to me asking if I knew how to fix helicopters. He pulled a tiny four-blade/two-prop self-balancing heli could only spin up one propellor. Without any tools, I couldn't fix it, but the small drive gear wasn't meshing with the second prop gear. Showed him the view through the FatShark goggles, and his awe was pretty much exactly how I felt when I got to FPV the first time.
