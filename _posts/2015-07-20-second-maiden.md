Objective this time around was to get better at throttle control and executing yaw/roll moves at the same time (radial motion). Generally happy with how that all worked out. Took one hard landing which made the front-right prop arm collapse, but that's as intended. Awesome.

Five-minute timer on the 9X feels a little restrictive - definitely feels like the batteries are increasing their runtime as I cycle them.

- Walk-the-dog
- Out-and-back
- Out-and-back with orientation change
- Launch + Descend (1:08, 1:29, 2:19) (avoid [vortex ring state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring_state ""Leaf on the Wind""))

Also, a little boy came up to me asking if I knew how to fix helicopters. Out of a tiny box he pulled a four-blade/two-prop self-balancing heli which could only spin up one propellor. I couldn't fix it without any tools, but through the vents in the frame you could see the small drive gear wasn't meshing with the second prop gear. I showed him and his sister how you needed to make them mesh so they'd rotate, I don't know if they're be able to fix it but I hope so. When he asked why I had goggles, I showed him the view through the FatSharks and waved I waved the VorteX at his sister. His awe was pretty much exactly how I felt when I got to FPV the first time.

This is a sweet hobby.
