Maiden flight today, Hanging out with friends (spotters).

Started out LOS, with them having the fpv goggles, pretty sure whoever was first on the dominators got airsick, lol. Fortunately I'd figured out the FC mode toggle, and setting it into horizon mode made everything smooth as butter. Punched up higher than the trees and gave them a sweet view - the image quality coming over the wire on these Dominators are so sweet and stable. So much better than the Hubsan X4 used to be.

Taking the gogoggles, FPV was harder than expected. Having done all those flight sims way back in the day I felt like it'd be easier. NOPE. Part of that likely has to do with how different the roll character on a heli is from a plane. Hopefully as I add horizontal speed that'll get a little easier.
