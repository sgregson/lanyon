Conditions this time around were less-than-ideal, mostly because I waited around too long and it had gotten a little dark (*blame a tasty soba noodle dinner and be happy for it*). Practice-wise it was more of the same - launches and radial moves. Two observations - (1) Man, is the LED panel ever bright! (2) The FPV camera has suprisingly good low-light detail. The illumination was 90% streetlamps, and the fact that I could make out the terrain change in the grass is impressive.

Unfortunately, by the time I got into the groove - about to load the second battery - it started raining and I had to pack it up in a hurry. I'm glad the backpack showed up today.

New arrivals:

1. Backpack (evecase 15.6" Laptop / DSLR Camera Backpack)
2. Antenna cable guards / mount (45deg-90deg mounting bracket)
3. Transmitter Lanyard (rebel alliance)

I have mixed feelings on the lanyard; I don't think I relax my arms enough yet (certainly not when **LOS**) to make use of it or it's too short.
