Went to MacDonald Park in Medford to take out the Vortexes (vortices?). Having that much space to fly is SO much better - it's easy enough to practice maneuvers in JP but to really get some velocity behind the turns you need more space. So cool seeing these things zipping around the field! *[Vortex vs. Vortex, who shall win](http://posters.keepcalmandposters.com/4737577.jpg "Two drones enter, one drone leaves")?*

Merlin (the pup) had a hard time until the drones were in the air - once they were up, he was too enthralled to be a bother :)

## Flight Notes:

- The yaw/roll sliding turn is a lot easier with speed, not to mention more of a slide. Moving at a slow clip horizontally is a lot more difficult to control, but having gotten a feel for what that means in real space (practicing Line-of-Sight) made the transition a lot easier.
- If I get caught up in all the excitment, I sometimes forget which stick handles yaw vs. roll - not great when you need to recover
- The camera mount gets a little loose over a number of runs, should pack a small hex key to tighten it up in the field
- The mAh-consumed marker in the OSD is more useful than any of the other data points - knowing the voltage never drops below 9.5v is good to prevent deep-drawing the cells, but ultimately the mAh consumed provides a more reliable runtime measurement.
  - *look into the accuracy of each measurements*
