## Second Maiden

Objective is to get better at throttle control and executing yaw/roll moves at the same time (radial motion). Generally happy with how that all worked out.

- Walk-the-dog
- Out-and-back
- Out-and-back with orientation change
- Launch + Descend

Took one hard landing which made the front-right prop arm collapse, but that's as intended. Awesome.
