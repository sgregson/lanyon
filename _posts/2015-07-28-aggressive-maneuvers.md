Medium sized crash this time around! Smacked right into a tree at a fair clip, sideways, bent two propellors (right side front/rear) and folded the same prop arms. I'm really impressed with this frame, both it's reliliency and it's optimizations. I've still not graduated from 3S to 4S LiPo batteries yet, but we'll get there!

I also figured out the video problem - or reliably solved it. It was one of two things:

* NTSC mode - I took the NTSC jumper out of the FS 700 TVL camera and *BOOM* the video quality was impressively better. There was a forum post somewhere which described a field "as if it were drawn by a pencil" and I had been experiencing the exact same thing.
* Starting up the Goggles/DVR before the frame's vTx was fully initialized. I'm pretty sure the glitchy images at the bottom of the screen were happening because it tried to hook into a video signal which was being set-up.

The results? Way better video (still working out that audio glitch, though):

I don't know what the audio of this clips is going to look like, but I'm pretty excited that I was able to get the internal and external video to sync up!
