Great tools make a silly site like this possible, without which it would be entirely boring. Support these content creators and learn how awesome the web can be with an open source publishing platform!

**Jekyll via github pages**  
Because obviously. One of the easiest ways these days to get a site running and future-proof with the ability to add a CNAME later

**Lanyon** http://lanyon.getpoole.com/  
The Lanyon Jekyll theme built on Poole, which enables the snazzy look and responsive feel.

**Prose.io** http://prose.io/  
An incredibly straightforward way to create content on a Github repo. A simple markdown editor makes it easy to create jekyll-ready pages and keeps my workflow simple.

**Geojson.io** http://geojson.io  
Probably the easiest way to make notes-style maps. Quick snippets of geography are perfect for remembering where and when you crashed your quad.
